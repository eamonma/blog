Making a timetable planner is not an original thought for U of T students.

In fact, in the day immediately following our initial public release on Reddit, [someone else released a schedule planner + other stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/vi7e9a/introducing_uoft_index/). In total, I count eight planners; I've included ones that are *reasonably* up to date, so not historically-functional-but-no-longer ones like Semesterly or others that show up when you Google "uoft timetable planner":

- [the official ArtSci timetable](https://timetable.iit.artsci.utoronto.ca), the "official" one that would not scroll properly,
- [Griddy](http://griddy.org), the one everybody used before 2022,
- [VIAPlanner](https://timetable.viaplanner.ca/about), a planner with autogeneration,
- [Courseography Grid](https://courseography.cdf.toronto.edu/grid),
- [the new official TTB planner](https://uoftindex.ca/timetable) (whose API we plan to steal),
- [the PalmTree Studios app](https://palmtree.studio/uoftimetable/),
- [U of T Index](https://uoftindex.ca/timetable), and of course,
- [Sqrl Planner](https://app.sqrlplanner.com).

In fact, to further drive home how unoriginal this idea is, the idea of Sqrl was conceived from a first year course assignment—specifically, CSC110 assignment 3, where we created a ✨timetable planner✨ that automatically generated different versions of a scheudle for you, given courses you wanted to take. Why is this? I suppose in retrospect it is a straightforward and attractive side project idea for CS kids: it's fairly easy to get the data—at least for the Faculty of Arts and Science, and it's not terribly difficult to show divs on a table.

## Why make Sqrl?
So then, with four of these above already existing when we conceived of Sqrl, why did we decide to conceive of Sqrl? Is it masochism? Because in this particular domain, there are lots of headaches that compound with writing a timetable planner. I will highlight two.

### Updates
**The data needs to be up-to-date.** Our goal for Sqrl was for it to be the best timetable planner for U of T, so it **at least** needed to:
- offer a much improved experience over existing solutions, and
- be reliably used for not just this year and the next, but far into the future. 

To achieve this, the minimum bar we needed to pass was for the data to be up to date—and this is rather non-trivial. For one, the Faculty's website API is not public, so they can make breaking changes without telling anyone, or feeling guilty about it. Funnily enough, we've already experienced this even before launch: we began writing the data-fetching code for Sqrl in the summer of 2021, working off of that year's data, and by early 2022, the API made breaking changes for the delivery mode field, from `SYNC` to `INPER` (why?).

That was our first WTF moment with the API: since we made the assumption that the delivery mode field would be enumerated to the values that existed in 2022, we had to dig through the stack trace to see that `INPER` was not, in fact, a value we've ever seen before. The further along we were with development, the more we see the motif of **assumptions** return.

### Scattered sources
**The sources for courses and their sections are everywhere,** which is why we focused on the FAS timetable for v1.0. That is a lie. We intended on only supporting the FAS timetable in addition to UTSC and UTM at a later date, but then [someone said they would send us money if we added grad courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/vhdkcy/comment/id7sgfg/). Grad courses are offered on each department's website, and as far as I know, they have no public centrally aggregated source. 

This means that we would need to write a custom parser for each department, and we quickly realized that our current backend architecture was not conducive to this, so we decided to rearchitect the backend. Specifically, the original backend had everything in one app, so synching the data sources and saving timetables were the responsiblities of the same project. With the new-and-improved backend, we have a data aggregator, aptly named `gator`, and the backend server is only responsible for saving timetables and proxying requests to `gator`.

This problem of sources being everywhere is compounded by things potentially needing to be updated every year, and you can quickly see why so many planners get abandoned. How does Sqrl solve this problem? It doesn't, but it works with it as best as possible. We've eased both problems by treating the fetcher for each data source as a function; that way, updates are automated, changes in the API can be reflected in the fetching code as straightforward as possible, and the sources each have their own function.
